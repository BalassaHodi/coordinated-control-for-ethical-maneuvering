# Coordinated control design for ethical manuevering

## Scenario 1 - Control design for the situation with one autonomous and one human-driven vehicle

This Matlab project is the implementation of the contorl design for the situation where an individual autonomous vehicle tries to avoid the collision with a pedestrian and a human-driven vehicle.

The ethical concept of the control design is based on the article: _Németh, B. Coordinated Control Design for Ethical Manuevering of Autonomous Vehicles. Energies 2023, 16, 4254._

The scripts were wirtten by: Balassa Hódi.
