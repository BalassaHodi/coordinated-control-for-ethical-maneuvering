# Coordinated control design for ethical manuevering

## Scenario 2 - Control design for the situation with two autonomous vehicles

This Matlab project is the implementation of the contorl design for the situation where two autonomous vehicles try to avoid a collision with a pedestrian.

The ethical concept of the control design is based on the article: _Németh, B. Coordinated Control Design for Ethical Manuevering of Autonomous Vehicles. Energies 2023, 16, 4254_.

In this project the ethical concept is extended to the case of cooperative control of two autonomous vehicles, where the two participants try to avoid the collision together based on a control design developed by me.

The scripts were wirtten by: Balassa Hódi.

## Run the script
Open the folder in Matlab, and type in the command window:
